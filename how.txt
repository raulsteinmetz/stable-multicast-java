each process holds known lamport vectors of every other process

buffer with every message sent or received

if a process fails before its message is delivered to all, other process with a copy in the buffer can forward that message
the process who hasnt received the message has to detect it

when a message is detected to have been received by all the processes, it can be poped from the buffer

messages buffered must contain lamport matrix and id of the sender
